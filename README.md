# 1. 💠 Introduction :

* Creation of a **web-based** **`chatroom`** using **client/server** infrastructure and implementating features such as:
    * sending :
        * vocals (if possible)
        * photos
        * messages
    * types of chats :
        * private
        * group
        * server (if possible)
    * calls (highly doubt it due to its difficulty to implement)

# 2. :hammer: Creation :

## 2.1. 🤔 Why ? :

- **Privacy :**
    - nowdays most of big companies chat applications **steal personal data/informations**
    - most of the private conversations are not really 'private', they are kept and logged by big companies 

- **Security :**
    - some chat applications may use **weak encryption method**, which would result in data being able to be **intercepted**
